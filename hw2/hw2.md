# Homework 2  
This folder is for storing the solutions (in this case, Jupyter notebooks) for Homework 2 in the LSDA course. Two files can be found:  
1. **NO-IMPROVEMENTS_LSDA2020_Traffic_Signs_Assignment_Final.ipynb**  
This notebook includes the CNN model before any improvements were applied (none of my implemented data augmentations either besides the 
ones that were already present in the notebook from the beginning).

2. **ALL-IMPROVEMENTS_LSDA2020_Traffic_Signs_Assignment_Final.ipynb**  
This notebook includes the CNN model after all the improvements (as mentioned in the report) were applied.
